# THE FIRST STEP APP

This is "The First Step" application, created in order to achive a better understanding on how the daily alcool consumption can impact on our life quality and health. 
Even if initially designed for a more complex purpouse, the application will acquire Heart Rate and Steps data of the user and compare them with the user alcoholic consumption. 
It will help the user to have a visual and very simple assessment of his/her behaviour, in the chosen day.

This app is designed to work on the previous day, with respect to the day of the access. But, of course this modality would be more suited for real time data.
